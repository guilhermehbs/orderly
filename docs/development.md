# üèóÔ∏è Development Standards in Orderly  

## üîπ Backend Architecture (Hexagonal - Spring Boot)  
We follow the **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)** to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and testability.  

### **Main Layers**  
- **Application Layer (Use Cases):** Contains business logic and orchestrates operations.  
- **Domain Layer:** Represents core business rules, independent of external dependencies.  
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Handles persistence (JPA), messaging (Kafka), external APIs, and other integrations.  

### **Adapters (Ports and Adapters Pattern)**  
- **Primary Adapters (Driving):** REST Controllers, CLI, and other entry points that trigger use cases.  
- **Secondary Adapters (Driven):** Database repositories, external APIs, Kafka consumers, etc.  

### **Additional Architectural Principles**  
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Used for input/output data transformation.  
- **Exception Handling:** Centralized error management with `@ControllerAdvice`.  
- **Security:** Authentication and authorization with Spring Security and JWT.  

## üîπ Technologies  
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka  
- **Frontend Web:** React.js + Vite, TypeScript  
- **Mobile:** React Native + Expo  
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka for event-driven communication between services.  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for test automation and deployments.  
- **Containerization:** Docker and Kubernetes for scalable deployments.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform for managing cloud infrastructure.  

## üîπ Coding Standards  
- **Follow SOLID principles** to maintain a clean and scalable codebase.  
- **Use Design Patterns** where applicable (Factory, Singleton, Strategy, etc.).  
- **Ensure Code Readability** with meaningful variable and function names.  
- **Keep Functions Short & Focused** (Single Responsibility Principle).  
- **Follow the Dependency Inversion Principle** to keep business logic independent of frameworks.  

## üîπ Best Practices  
- Well-documented and modularized code.  
- Use of automated tests:  
  - **Unit Tests:** JUnit for Java, Jest for React.  
  - **Integration Tests:** TestContainers for PostgreSQL.  
  - **End-to-End Tests:** Cypress for frontend testing.  
- Structured logging with **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana).  
- **API Documentation** using OpenAPI (Swagger).  
- **Versioning APIs** to prevent breaking changes.  

## üîπ Security Guidelines  
- Use **JWT for authentication** and implement role-based access control (RBAC).  
- **Sanitize user inputs** to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.  
- **Encrypt sensitive data** before storing in the database.  
- **Enable HTTPS** for secure communication.  
- Implement **Rate Limiting** to prevent abuse of endpoints.  

## üîπ Branching and Workflow (Git Flow)  
- `main`: Production-ready code only.  
- `develop`: Active development branch.  
- `feature/feature-name`: For new features.  
- `bugfix/bug-name`: For bug fixes.  
- `hotfix/hotfix-name`: Urgent fixes in production.  
- `release/release-version`: Preparing for a new release.  

## üîπ Pull Requests & Code Reviews  
- **All changes must go through a Pull Request (PR)** before merging.  
- **Follow Conventional Commits** for structured commit messages.  
- **Ensure at least one code review** before merging to `develop` or `main`.  
- **Write meaningful PR descriptions**, explaining the context of changes.  
- **Use GitHub Actions to run tests automatically** before approving PRs.  

## üîπ Deployment Strategy  
- **Staging Environment:** Deploys automatically from `develop`.  
- **Production Environment:** Deploys from `main` after passing all tests.  
- **Blue-Green Deployments** to ensure zero downtime.  
- **Feature Flags:** Used to control feature rollout without redeploying.  

## üîπ Monitoring & Observability  
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Using Prometheus and Grafana.  
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry for real-time monitoring of application errors.  
- **Distributed Tracing:** Jaeger for microservices debugging.
