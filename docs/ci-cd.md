# ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline in Orderly

## ðŸ”¹ Objective
Automate tests, builds, and deployments to ensure code stability, consistency, and high availability of the application.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD for automated builds, testing, and deployments.  
- **Docker:** Containers to isolate and standardize the application environment.  
- **AWS ECS/Fargate:** Serverless container orchestration for automated deployments.  
- **SonarQube:** Static code analysis for quality and security.  
- **Terraform:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage AWS resources.  
- **PostgreSQL RDS:** Managed database service for production workloads.  
- **Prometheus & Grafana:** Monitoring and alerting for system performance.  

## ðŸ”¹ Deployment Workflow
1. **Push to the `main` branch** â†’ Triggers the CI/CD pipeline.  
2. **Code Linting & Static Analysis** â†’ SonarQube checks for code quality, vulnerabilities, and technical debt.  
3. **Automated Tests Execution** â†’ Runs unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.  
4. **Build and Package Application** â†’ Creates Docker images for backend and frontend.  
5. **Push Docker Images to AWS ECR** â†’ Stores container images in a private registry.  
6. **Deploy to AWS ECS (Fargate)** â†’ Updates running services with zero downtime.  
7. **Database Migrations** â†’ Runs database migrations if necessary.  
8. **Post-Deployment Monitoring** â†’ Prometheus and Grafana track system health and alert on issues.  

## ðŸ”¹ Branching Strategy
- **`main`** â†’ Stable and production-ready code.  
- **`develop`** â†’ Active development and integration of new features.  
- **`feature/feature-name`** â†’ Branches for developing new features.  
- **`hotfix/hotfix-name`** â†’ Critical fixes for production issues.  

## ðŸ”¹ Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests** â†’ Ensures individual components function correctly.  
- **Integration Tests** â†’ Validates interactions between system components.  
- **End-to-End Tests** â†’ Simulates real user flows to verify system behavior.  
- **Security Scans** â†’ Detects vulnerabilities and compliance issues.  

## ðŸ”¹ Rollback Strategy
- **Automatic Health Checks** â†’ Detects failed deployments and prevents bad releases.  
- **Blue-Green Deployment** â†’ Deploys a new version alongside the existing one, ensuring a smooth transition.  
- **Revert to Previous Version** â†’ Roll back to a stable Docker image in case of failures.  

## ðŸ”¹ Security & Compliance
- **Secrets Management:** Uses AWS Secrets Manager and GitHub Actions secrets.  
- **Access Control:** Implements IAM roles with least privilege access.  
- **Code Signing:** Ensures only trusted images are deployed.  
- **Audit Logs:** Maintains logs for deployment history and security events.  

## ðŸ”¹ Performance Optimization
- **Auto Scaling:** AWS ECS automatically scales based on traffic and workload.  
- **Caching:** Uses Redis for improved performance and reduced database load.  
- **Load Balancing:** AWS ALB distributes traffic efficiently across services.
